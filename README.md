## [Purpose](#purpose)
This portfolio website is to present myself as a Developer and IT Professional. The portfolio website serves as a means to showcase my abilities in planning, designing, building and deploying a multi-page website about myself - including skills, interests, professional knowledge and any prior work.

## [Functionality/Features](#functionality)
The portfolio website has been created with a clean, simplistic yet modern design in mind. A nice linear gradient colour scheme is met with the users eyes on each of the main pages (**Home, About, Portfolio, Blog and Contact**) psuedo elements have been used to provide a nice and intriguing design to draw the user in and keep them engaged. Simple and clean fonts have been used throughout to follow the theme of a modern and clean look.

The Wesbite has been built with mobile-first in mind to ensure compatabilty not only on desktop and laptop screen sizes but also on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This has been implemented uitlising flexbox, viewport measurements and media queries.

Additional functionality and features include:

- **Home Page** with a profile photo and brief intro to myself.
- **About page** which expands more on myself, work, experience and travels.
- **Portfolio page** which lists some of my recent projects.
- **Blog Page** with a listing of five blog posts.
- **Contact Page** which has a contact form for user input and link to social accounts and Resume.
- Navigation Bar to access all pages.
- Hamburger menu bar with smooth drop down transition, for smaller screens.
